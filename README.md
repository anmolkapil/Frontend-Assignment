## Problem Statement

You have to create a React application that will allow users to paste a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application will have a single screen which will be divided into two equal sections next to each other. On the left section will be a JSON editor to paste the UI-Schema. On the right section, a form will be automatically rendered based on the pasted UI-Schema.

## Built with

This project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: To catch development erros.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **React Hook Form**: A library to manage forms with minimal re-renders using React hooks.
- **Shadcn**: Open source components library.
- **clsx**: A tiny utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally.
